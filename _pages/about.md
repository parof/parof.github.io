I am a PhD Sudent in Computer Science at the Sorbonne University (Paris) 
under the supervision of Professor [Antoine Miné](https://www-apr.lip6.fr/~mine/), 
within the [ERC MOPSA project](http://mopsa.lip6.fr/).
Previously, I obtained a BSc and an MSc in Computer Science at [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/) (Italy).
For my [Master's Thesis](https://parof.github.io/files/Parolini_MThesis.pdf) I worked on the 
language inclusion problem for ω-regular languages.

My research interests include **security** and **automated formal methods**, in particular
by **Abstract Interpretation**.
